## About Me

Hey everyone, and welcome to my little corner of the internet! My name is Ben, but all my friends call me BL, and I'm a Commerce & Computer Science student at Queen's University currently living in Toronto. I am passionate about many things, but a few that you would probably be interested in are business development, finance, AI, software development, data science and UI/UX design. My journey into the world of technology and innovation came from, well… innovation! I am obsessed with the constant technological innovation that is happening all around us: AI, quantum computing, you name it. My fascination with innovation has blossomed into a career aspiration to create meaningful and innovative solutions on the cutting edge of our technological capabilities.

When I'm not coding, you can probably find me with my friends rock-climbing, exploring the outdoors, travelling, or maybe cooking something absolutely delicious.
